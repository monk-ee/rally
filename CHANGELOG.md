### 0.2.1

* [External benchmarks can now specify target hosts and ports](https://github.com/elastic/rally/issues/83)
* Ability to [add a user-defined tag as metric meta-data](https://github.com/elastic/rally/issues/84)

[All changes](https://github.com/elastic/rally/issues?q=milestone%3A0.2.1+is%3Aclosed)

### 0.2.0

Major changes:

* Rally can now [benchmark a binary Elasticsearch distribution](rally/issues#63) (starting with Elasticsearch 5.0.0-alpha1).
* Reporting improvements for [query latency](elastic/rally#10) and [indexing throughput](elastic/rally#59) on the command line.
* We store [benchmark environment data](elastic/rally#54) alongside metrics.
* A new percolator track](elastic/rally#74) contributed by [Martijn van Groningen](https://github.com/martijnvg). Thanks!

### 0.1.0

Major changes:

* Added a [JIT profiler](https://github.com/elastic/rally/issues/43). This allows to check warmup times but also in-depth inspection which
optimizations were performed by the JIT compiler. If the HotSpot disassembler library is available, the logs will also contain the 
disassembled JIT compiler output which can be used for low-level analysis. We recommend to use 
[JITWatch](https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/jitwatch) for analysis.
* Added [pipeline support](https://github.com/elastic/rally/issues/61). Pipelines allow to define more flexibly which steps Rally executes
during a benchmark. One of the use-cases for this is to run a benchmark based on a released build of Elasticsearch rather than building it
ourselves.

### 0.0.3

Major changes:

* Migrated the metrics data store from file-based to a dedicated Elasticsearch instance. Graphical reports can be created with 
  Kibana (optional but recommended). It is necessary to setup an Elasticsearch cluster to store metrics data (a single node 
  is sufficient). The cluster will be configured automatically by Rally. For details please see the [README](README.rst).
